Welcome everyone, to this **React** learning program/workshop. Before getting started with the videos and reading materials let’s briefly ponder upon some of the W/H questions...

- What is React ?
- Why React ?
- How React ?

and more...

### WHAT ,WHY & HOW OF REACT …

According to the [official website](https://reactjs.org/) it is `A JavaScript library for building user interfaces`.  
So this definition might make you wonder, that plain HTML/CSS/JS can be used to do the same, i.e. `...building user interfaces`.  
What’s **special** about React ??  

React changes the way of building web interfaces by essentially breaking the interface into smaller more manageable components.

- [Component-Based Architecture:](https://medium.com/@dan.shapiro1210/understanding-component-based-architecture-3ff48ec0c238)  As mentioned, in a React application the whole interface is divided into smaller components. This helps in…

  - **Increasing code modularity:** Simply put, in terms of the code it helps us break large blobs of code into smaller and manageable ‘pieces of code’ that are self-sustained in terms of their functionality and styling. (You’ll realise the significance of this as you start working on bigger projects with large codebases.)

  - **Reusability and Scalability:**  An obvious result of the previous point is that we can reuse these components wherever and however many times in your application. Thus scaling the application, adding/removing features becomes much more convenient.


- [Client-Side Rendering:](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/web-architecture-server-side-render-or-client-side-render-f16b61cd6299)  In the context of web client refers to the browser. Thus the term refers to “rendering web pages” within the browser which is done completely on the server in Server-Side Rendering.

Don’t worry if you don’t understand all of it just yet because it may be difficult to wrap your head around these more higher-level concepts before gaining some experience in development.  
We’ll go through a few of these concepts in the concluding live session where along with some brief technical demos, we’ll discuss how to take it further from here.  

### Hope you all have an enjoyable learning experience ahead :)
